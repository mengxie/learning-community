Buddying
========

When a new person joins the community the admin randomly assigns an active member to help them find their feet.

1. Reach out to the new member and organise to catch up (in person or call)
1. Find out where their skills are at currently and what they would like to focus on learning
1. Think about people in the community to connect them with - focus on finding them people to learn beside, someone to learn from and someone to teach
1. Post up a welcome post in the Welcome to the group thread in Loomio @mention peoplethey should connect with.

Once the initial meeting has happened and the welcome post is up the admin will transfer one time credit from the time bank to the buddy
