###EDA Learning Community

This repo is the home of our community learning programme which is designed to help people of all skill levels connect with people who can help them improve.

All the learning materials and software are free and open source and you are most welcome to join our community or use these resources to build your own.

### What we do
* **Create and curate** a collection of free online learning resources
* Use a time bank for people to access **1 on 1 support**
* **Host workshops** for people to learn together
* Hone our skills by working on **open source projects**

### Our Digital Spaces
* We make decisions together in our [Loomio Group](https://www.loomio.org/g/leF7i2Zn/enspiral-academy-learning-community)
* We connect in real time in #eda on irc.freenode.net (IRC Quick Setup)
* We share resources in our [Google plus group](https://plus.google.com/communities/111826656011502132993)
* We have a [Chalkle Channel](http://devacademy.chalkle.com) with our upcoming Workshops

### Everybody learns, everybody teaches
People learn fastest when there is someone ahead of them they can learn from, people along side them who they can learn with and people coming after them they can teach.

### Time bank
We use a simple time bank to create an internal marketplace for learning and teaching opportunities. People can earn time credits by running workshops, preparing learning materials, reviewing code or one on one mentoring. 

We are bootstrapping this with a simple spreadsheet for the time being.

#### Viewing your balance
Checkout [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AudkcrKwMspodGFRdkU5QXVMMTBHUXhsVlMzOUxsdmc#gid=1)

#### Sending time credits
Email [community@devacademy.co.nz](mailto:community@devacademy.co.nz) with the person you would like to give credits to, the amount of credits and a description.

#### Requesting time credits
Email the person you are requesting credits from and cc [community@devacademy.co.nz](mailto:community@devacademy.co.nz) 

### Learning Plans
We encourage people to create a public github repo with their learning plan so that it is easier for the community to support them to achieve their objectives e.g.

### Diversity
We are committed to maintaining [Enspiral's Diversity Policy](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/agreements/diversity.md) and making this community a welcoming space for people from different backgrounds.

Please keep this in mind and help us make programming accessible to anyone who would like to be part of this community.
