###What is IRC?

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a chat system on the internet. It allows lots of people to have conversations, either in channels, or 1 to 1 directly. IRC is used all over the world, for big and small communities. It's a really common way for programmers to chat and get help.

IRC channels are generally specific to a topic or a community, and have names that starts with a '#'. An example is *#firefox* or *#help*. IRC channels are hosted on IRC networks. They have an address, which usually starts with 'irc'. An example is *irc.freenode.org*. A server has many channels, and users can also chat directly with other users on the network. It's easy to make your own channel.

###How do I use it?

You connect to an IRC network with an IRC client. These clients are usually just a program on your computer or phone, although there are also web clients available.

* [Quassel IRC](http://quassel-irc.org/)

**Mac**
